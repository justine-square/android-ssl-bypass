The code in this directory is based on the JDB debugger code (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/solaris/jdb.html)
and implements attaching to a remote virtual machine. The very minimum functionality has been implemented. Currently only attaching
to a vm is supported. There is much left to do here.
